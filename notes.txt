VOL_CHANGE

represents the percentage change in trading volume for the given date compared to the previous trading day

Positive VOL_CHANGE:
	•	If the value is positive, it indicates that there was more trading activity on that day compared to the previous day.
	•	Higher volume on positive return days can signal strong market momentum and increased interest in the asset.
Negative VOL_CHANGE:
	•	A negative value shows that the trading volume has decreased compared to the previous day.
	•	Lower volume can suggest waning interest or weaker momentum in the market, or that the price changes are less significant.

Can use VOL_CHANGE as a factor to filter trading signals, ensuring that you only enter trades when volume supports the price movement 
(i.e., strong moves on increasing volume).
