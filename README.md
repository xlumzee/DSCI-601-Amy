### About the data

##### Date - Timestamp for the data

##### RET - Return on a stock over a given period of time

##### Vol_Change - Changes in trading volume. Increase in volume can signify high interest, while a decrease might suggest less interest.

##### BA_Spread - Difference between the highest price a buyer is willing to pay (bid) and the lowest price a seller is willing to accept (ask). A narrower spread often indicates a more liquid market or higher market efficiency, whereas a wider spread can indicate lower liquidity or higher risk.

##### Illiquidity - A measure of the difficulty of trading a stock without affecting its price. High illiquidity means the stock is not easily tradable without significant price changes, which can increase the cost of trading and the risk.

##### Sprtrn - Return of the S&P 500 index, which is a market-capitalization-weighted index of the 500 largest U.S. publicly traded companies. The S&P 500 is a common benchmark for U.S. stock performance.

##### Turnover - refers to the total volume of shares traded during a specific period divided by the total shares outstanding. High turnover can indicate high trading activity, suggesting interest or volatility in the stock.

##### Dji_Return - return on the Dow Jones Industrial Average, another major stock market index in the United States. It consists of 30 large, publicly-owned companies based in the United States.
